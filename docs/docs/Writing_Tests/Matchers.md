# Matchers

Not all agentic behavior can be specified with precise, traditional checking methods. Instead, more often than not, we expect AI models to generalize and thus respond slightly differently to different inputs.

To accommodate this, `testing` includes several different `Matcher` implementations, that allow you to write tests that rely on fuzzy, similarity-based or property-based conditions.
